    <h3 id="idea">Why another OCR option? Why like this?</h3>
    <p>
      Most Sanskrit students and scholars are not using truly high-quality OCR,
      for the reason that it tends to be technologically just out of reach.
      <a href="https://www.tylerneill.info/blog-kalpataru-diaries/ocr-options">This blog post</a>
      justifies why Google Cloud Vision is worth helping expand access to.
      Granted, other, larger AI models may now outperform it in some cases,
      but interfacing with them can be even more complex,
      So for now, I'm still focusing on Cloud Vision.
      This interface removes (almost) all of the difficulty of working with it,
      including the need for coding or cloud file management.
    </p>

    <h3 id="api-key">Why do I need an API key? How do I get it?</h3>
    <p>
      Because Google Cloud Vision isn't free,
      and because I don't yet have funding to cover the cost for everyone,
      I pass the billing aspect along to individual users.
      Specifically, an API key tied to a billing-enabled Google Cloud account is required.
      Generated in connection wth such an account,
      an API key is essentially a secret string of characters, like a password.
      You can create and destroy as many as you like, at any time.
      Follow the video instructions below to set up a Google Cloud billing account,
      enable Cloud Vision, and generate an API key.

      <ol class="mt-14">
        <li>
          <strong>Go to the Google Cloud Console</strong>:<br>
          While logged into your Google account,
          visit the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console</a>.
          If it's your first time, you may need to click through some initial setup prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enable billing</strong>:<br>
          Walk through the steps at
          <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing" target="_blank">console.cloud.google.com/billing</a> to enable billing.
          You'll need a credit card. (<a href="#cost">See above</a> for more on cost.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Select a project</strong>:<br>
          Either create a new project (click <em>New Project</em> in the top navigation dropdown),
          or, if this is your first time, just use the default (“My First Project”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enable the Cloud Vision API</strong>:<br>
          In the left sidebar, go to <em>APIs & Services → Library</em>.
          Search for “Cloud Vision API” (it has a blue diamond logo).
          Click it, then click the blue <em>Enable</em> button.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Create an API key</strong>:<br>
          Go to <em>APIs & Services → Credentials</em>.
          Click <em>+ Create Credentials</em> and select <em>API key</em>.
          <br>
          A long string will appear. This is your API key.
          Copy it, store it securely, and treat it like a financial password.
          With this key, anyone can charge OCR processing
          (or other services, if you don't restrict the key) to your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(Optional) Restrict the key</strong>:<br>
          In the API key management screen,
          click the three dots next to your key, and choose <em>Edit</em>.
          Click <em>Restrict key</em>, and from the dropdown, select Cloud Vision API.
          Don't forget to click Save.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the key</strong>:<br>
          You're now ready to return to the <a href="/ocr">OCR page</a>
          and paste your key into the field labeled “Google Cloud API key.”
        </li>
      </ol>
    </details>

    <h3 id="cost">How much will it cost?</h3>
    <p>
      In most cases, virtually nothing.
      The first 1,000 pages per month are free.
      After that, every additional 1,000 pages costs $1.50.
      You pay only for what you use.
      New accounts come with a generous $300 credit, valid for 90 days.
      It's possible to track your usage
      (e.g., see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/ou5mw0/hello_im_noob_i_use_google_cloud_vision_and/?rdt=39873">this Reddit post</a>),
      but if you're working on personal projects, you likely won't exceed 1,000 pages a month.
    </p>

    <h3 id="safety">Is this safe? Can I trust you/Google?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, this is as safe as any other use of a password.
      To prevent your API key from falling into the wrong hands,
      I recommend storing it with a password manager (e.g., 1Password).
      As for Google, you don’t need to worry about them doing anything with the contents of your PDF.
      If you're concerned, just avoid uploading sensitive material.
      As for me and my code: I guarantee that your API key is never stored.
      The code, which is entirely open source, simply
      reads the key from the HTML form,
      sends it with the OCR request to Google,
      and that's it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="input-size">How big can the input be?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, files up to <strong>~{{ max_size }} MB</strong> are supported.
      Larger files must be split into parts.
    </p>

    <h3 id="complex-page">Will it work with complex page formats?</h3>
    <p>
      Maybe, maybe not. Cropping your PDF pages often improves both accuracy and performance.
    </p>

    <h3 id="mistakes">Why are some characters wrong, words misplaced, etc.?</h3>
    <p>
      Most OCR results contain some errors.
      Google Cloud Vision tends to produce fewer errors than other options.
      Please review and clean up as needed, e.g., using regular expressions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="hard-returns">Why are lines returned as-is, e.g., with hyphenation?</h3>
    <p>
      This OCR option is more literal, and it won't stitch hyphenated words back together.
      This is another thing to review and clean up as needed.
